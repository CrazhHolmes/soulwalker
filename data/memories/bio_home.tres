pre_redaction_text = "The house had blue shutters. I remember because I helped my father paint them the summer I turned nine. We got more paint on ourselves than on the wood, and my mother laughed from the doorway, holding a pitcher of cold water that caught the afternoon light.

The kitchen always smelled like bread. There was a window above the basin where herbs grew in clay pots—rosemary, thyme, something purple I never learned the name of. My mother would hum while she worked. I can still hear it. The melody, if not the words.

My room was in the back, small but mine. I carved my initials into the beam above the bed when I was twelve. I wonder if they're still there. I wonder if the house is still there.

I haven't been back. I'm not sure I could find it if I tried."
