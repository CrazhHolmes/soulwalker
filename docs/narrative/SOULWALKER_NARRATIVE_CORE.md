        "[TRUST 95+] I had a brother. I don't anymore. Not dead—*redacted*. I visit his grave, except there's no grave. I remember his voice, except the memory is flagged and fading. That's why I work here. To stand next to the machine that took him."

        "[CLEARANCE 4+] I've performed ceremonies that weren't in the manual. Mirror-Walker special requests. People go in, and what comes out looks like them, sounds like them... but something's been swapped. I don't ask what. I don't want to know what's on the other side of the mirror."

        "[TRUST 100] The mirrors don't show reflections. They show the original. We're the reflections. We're what got projected out when someone needed a version of reality that could be controlled. I've met my original. She doesn't recognize me. She doesn't even have a face anymore. I'm the face that got assigned. [MAREN'S EYES UNFOCUS] ...I'm sorry. What were we discussing?

Feels like the only thing I control.",

She was offered a choice: continue the family business under Protocol oversight, with modified recipes, or join her grandmother in the archive. She chose to live. Every remedy she sells contains compliance compounds she once swore to fight against. She tells herself she helps by reducing doses where she can.",

      "fear": "That her grandmother's consciousness somehow persists—in Aethel-Astral, in the archive, somewhere—and knows what Veyla has become. That the old woman's face will appear in a mirror during a customer's Alignment, and Veyla will have to pretend not to see her.",

      "secret": "Caden joined the Archive to find what happened to his brother Tobin. He found it: Tobin was part of a resistance cell that discovered evidence of mass Alignment fraud—whole villages that never existed, manufactured to justify land seizures. The cell was eliminated and their memories distributed among the population as 'false nostalgia.' Caden's own memories of Tobin were supposed to be erased, but he was already inside the system by then. He bargained: his silence, his service, for the right to remember. He's been a model operative ever since. He keeps Tobin alive by remembering him, even though he can never speak his name.",

      "fear": "That one day he'll wake up and Tobin will be gone. That the bargain will break, or that he'll slip up and reveal he remembers, and they'll take the memory as punishment. Also: that Tobin would be ashamed of the things Caden has redacted to protect his own exception.",

      "secret": "Maren wasn't orphaned—she was extracted. Her parents were Tier 6 Architects who made the mistake of loving each other more than the system. When they tried to flee with her to Aethel-Astral, the Mirror-Walkers caught them at the threshold. Her parents were 'returned to the mirror'—their consciousnesses split, distributed, used as raw material for reality maintenance. Maren was raised by the system that consumed her parents. She knows this because she's seen fragments of them in the deep mirrors. A glimpse of her mother's smile in one reflection. Her father's worried eyes in another. They're not dead. They're infrastructure now. And Maren maintains them.",

      "fear": "That if she fails the system, she'll be fed to the mirrors too—and that she would recognize her parents' faces in the process, know they were watching, and that they would feel her joining them. Also: that the fragments recognize her and are trying to communicate, and she has to pretend not to see.",

Sela started noticing patterns—arrest orders that didn't match any crime, detainees who vanished from cells with no transfer paperwork. She tried to report it. Within a week, Bram's records showed he'd always patrolled alone. His memories of Sela are intact but feel increasingly dreamlike. He's begun documenting everything he can—descriptions, dates, things he notices. He hides the documents in a space he created under a loose cobblestone near the old fountain. He doesn't know why he does it. He just knows that someday, someone might need to know that Sela was real, and that she tried.",

      "fear": "That his memories of Sela are his own Calibration failing—that she really never existed, and he's experiencing a breakdown. Also: that she did exist, and that one day he'll forget her completely, and the documents under the cobblestone will be the only proof, and no one will ever find them.",

      "secret": "Aldric is fully aware of everything. The Redactions. The Mirror infrastructure. The Protocol language control. The Aethel-Astral substrate. He designed significant portions of the current system. He did so because he believes—genuinely, with full knowledge—that the alternative is worse. He was once a Questioner himself, a young man who pushed through to Tier 7 contact. He saw what reality looks like without the frame. He saw what the Hyper-Kingdom actually is. It broke him for three years. When he reconstructed himself, he came back committed to building the strongest possible frame. He's not a monster. He's a traumatized idealist who decided that managed lies are kinder than unmanageable truth. This makes him far more dangerous than a simple villain—he can justify everything with something like compassion.",

      "fear": "That he's wrong. That the system he's spent his life building is not a necessary shelter but an unnecessary cage. That the Aethel-Astral he saw and fled from wasn't chaos—it was freedom, and he was simply too weak to survive it. That he has imprisoned generations in his own cowardice and called it protection. [He never allows himself to consciously think this.]",

      "manual_override_phrase": "You don't understand what I've kept out. [Said only in moments of extreme confrontation. His deepest self-justification, surfacing against his will. He cannot say what 'I've kept out' refers to—his mind slides away from the image.]",

        "Sleeps with the lights on—has for decades",
        "Never uses mirrors if he can help it; when required for ceremonies, keeps his eyes closed and recites calibration mantras under his breath",

# APPENDIX A: LINGUISTIC DEPLOYMENT GUIDELINES
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

```
FOR DIALOGUE WRITERS: The following patterns should be deployed consistently
to maintain narrative coherence across all NPC interactions.
```

## Presupposition Structures

| Pattern | Example | Hidden Assumption |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| "When you..." | "When you accept the record..." | Acceptance is inevitable |
| "After you..." | "After you complete Alignment..." | Alignment will happen |
| "Now that you..." | "Now that you understand..." | Understanding achieved |
| "As you know..." | "As you know, we only want what's best." | Shared knowledge established |
| "You've always..." | "You've always been one of us." | Belonging is retroactive |

## Double Bind Constructions

| Setup | Option A | Option B | Hidden Frame |
|-------|----------|----------|--------------|
| "Do you prefer..." | "...now" | "...after the ceremony" | Both options include compliance |
| "Would you like..." | "...to understand" | "...to be comfortable" | Confusion = discomfort |
| "Will you..." | "...accept the truth" | "...continue being uncertain" | Uncertainty = rejection of truth |

## Euphemism Deployment Table

| Never Say | Always Say | Psychological Function |
|-----------|------------|----------------------|
| Kill/Execute | Archival Completion | Removes violence from death |
| Brainwash | Calibration | Medical/technical framing |
| Lie | Harmonize/Adjust | Makes deception constructive |
| Prison | Continuity Center | Removes punishment frame |
| Forget | Archive Internally | Storage, not loss |
| Spy | Observer/Liaison | Removes hostile intent |
| Punish | Realign | Corrective, not retributive |
| Control | Guide/Maintain | Removes coercion frame |
| Censor | Review/Verify | Quality control framing |
| Torture | Enhanced Calibration | [RESTRICTED TERM - Tier 5+] |

- Contacts with other observed individuals
- Uses phrase "That's not what I..."

**Stage 3 Indicators (Active Assessment):**
- Attempts to avoid Documentation Points
- Creates personal records (diaries, letters)
- Uses phrase "They want us to believe..."
- Questions other citizens about their memories

**Stage 4 Indicators (Immediate Intervention):**
