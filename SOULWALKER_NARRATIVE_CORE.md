# SOULWALKER: REDACTED ARCHIVE - NARRATIVE CORE

## Synopsis
Soulwalker is a 2D RPG about identity under institutional control. You play a character who wakes up into a world that feels normal on the surface—markets, guilds, temples, civic order—but the deeper truth is that reality is managed by layered systems: public institutions, secret societies, and something older that sits above them—an “astral” governance that treats human memory and perception like editable data.

The core conflict isn’t “good vs evil.” It’s official truth vs lived truth.

## Core Pillars
### 1. Redaction
Memory isn’t lost—it’s classified. You can feel the missing parts. The world contains evidence of what happened, but it’s been censored, renamed, and normalized.

### 2. Documents > Memories
The “real story” is hidden in archives, permits, logs, sealed vaults, and bureaucratic language. Progression is tied to cross-referencing contradictions and raising clearance.

### 3. Ritual as Technology
Public folk magic is actually a functional interface to hidden systems (protocols). Secret societies use these to navigate and manage reality.

### 4. Mirrors & Gates
Gateways across versions of reality. Navigation is based on coherence—what you know and what you remember.

## The Knowledge Ladder (NPC Awareness Tiers)
1. **Civilians (Asleep)**: Live normal lives, repeat slogans, distrust conspiracy talk.
2. **Institutional Workers (Compliant)**: Clerks, guards, inspectors. Know rules, not reasons.
3. **Fringe Seekers (Suspicious)**: Sense the gaps, collect rumors, fear surveillance.
4. **Initiates (Partial Access)**: Members of secret orders. Know symbols and basic protocols.
5. **Operatives (System Users)**: Manipulate perception and narrative control.
6. **Gatekeepers (Threshold Authorities)**: Reality hygiene, astral permissions.
7. **Archivists (Truth Custodians)**: Curate history; decide what is "Official."
8. **Beyond (Hyper Kingdom)**: Entities outside the map; treat worlds as provinces.

## Loop & Gameplay
1. **Interact**: Find contradictions in the world.
2. **Search**: Uncover redactions in documents.
3. **Recover**: Mix herbs and reflect to gain memory fragments.
4. **Unlock**: Use higher clearance to enter vaults and astral floors.
5. **Reframe**: New dialogue options unlock as you gain language for the truth.

## Tone & Feel
Paranoia + Awe. A world that looks calm but is entirely staged. Normality as horror. A fight to remain human in a programmable world.
